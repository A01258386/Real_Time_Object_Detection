# Real_Time_Object_Detection
Computer Vision to Help Nature

In this project, we will use Yolo v5 (YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection) to detect and classify various objects. The goal is to identify areas of nature that would benefit from AI and automatic detection/classification - for example, plastic detection in images in the ocean, whale detection to calculate the number of whales in specific seas, other animals, etc.

Steps:
1.find/create a dataset of images
2.annotate using Roboflow
3.train and test using the Yolo algorithm
4.optimize/apply additional methods
5.write a report
