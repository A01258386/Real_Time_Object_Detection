# Real_Time_Object_Detection
Computer Vision to Help Nature

In this project, we will use Yolo v5 (YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection) to detect and classify various objects. The goal is to identify areas of nature that would benefit from AI and automatic detection/classification - for example, plastic detection in images in the ocean, whale detection to calculate the number of whales in specific seas, other animals, etc.

For Solution Challenge, Please see the Jupyter Notebook : YOLOv5_Custom_Training.ipynb
